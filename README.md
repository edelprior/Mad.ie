## Local Setup


This React application uses [MDC React](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web-react) and requires a bit of extra setup to get started. To be able to run this locally you will need to [install Sass](https://sass-lang.com/install) using `npm install -g sass`.

Then clone the repository and install the app regularly with `npm install`.

To get MDC React Components to work with `create-react-app` you need to set a `SASS_PATH` environment variable that points to your `node_modules` directory. To quickly do this on OS X enter the following in your command line:

```sh
export SASS_PATH=./node_modules
```

If you're on Windows use the following:

```bat
SET SASS_PATH=.\node_modules
```
